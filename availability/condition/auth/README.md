moodle-availability_auth [![Build Status](https://github.com/bobopinna/moodle-availability_auth/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bobopinna/moodle-availability_auth/actions)
======================================

Restrict access based on user authentication method.

# Idea
User profile availability plugin does not include authetication methods. This plugin implement it.

This plugin only pops up when there is more than one valid authentication method is used in the system 
(obvious, we need a least 2 authentication method to restrict).
"No Login" is not a valid authentication method. A user with "No Login" as authentication method can not log in to Moodle.
