    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
      | student2 | C1     | student        |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | name | intro   | course | section |
      | page     | P1   | Test l  | C1     | 1       |
